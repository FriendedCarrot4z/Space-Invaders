# Summery
This is my first real game, space invaders. You fight off the invaders till you get hit. I used the mixer function from pygame to import music into the game(loud background musid warning), image load to bring in a background and different pictures for the objects as well. I also imported python math for collition and random to give the enemy different movement speeds and spawn locations.
